The RKB Foundation is a non-profit organization dedicated to creating positive change in communities around the world. Our motto is "Empowering Lives Through Service."

Our Vision: A world where all people have access to opportunity and the chance to realize their full potential.

Our Mission: To empower underserved communities through sustainable development projects focused on education, healthcare, economic growth, and environmental sustainability.

Our Goals:

- Provide access to quality education for children and adults. We build schools, donate supplies, and run literacy programs.

- Improve healthcare by offering medical camps, preventative care education, and access to essential medicines.

- Stimulate economic growth through vocational training, microloans, and development of local businesses.

- Promote environmental sustainability through renewable energy, conservation, and green technology projects.

At the core of our work is the belief that empowering people through service can lift up individuals, families, and entire communities. We partner with local organizations to implement programs that are tailored to each community's unique needs. By taking a collaborative approach, we aim to enact lasting change.

The RKB Foundation was founded in 2015 by a group of global citizens who seek to make the world a little bit better every day. No matter the obstacle, we are committed to serving communities in need.
